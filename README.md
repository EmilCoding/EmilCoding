- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @EmilCoding. I am a Danish guy with a background in physics. 
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in numerical methods, simulation tools, and tools that I generally can use in my workflow.
- ğŸ“« If you want to reach me, please send an e-mail to elboesen@gmail.com
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him and Emil (since it is my name).
- âš¡ Fun fact: My parents named me Emil after the main character of the book "Emil i LÃ¶nneberga" by Astrid Lindgren. Looking back at my childhood, the name was quite fitting.
